EtherBay
========

An Ethereum smart contract and website interface for incentivized requesting/distributing of content.
Smart contracts are used to show users proof-of-interest in requested content, and a refunded deposit
incentivizes requesters/backers to validate submitted content. IPFS's content-based addressing ensures
that there is no tampering of the distributed content after its upload.
