#EtherBay

An Ethereum smart contract and website interface for incentivized requesting/distributing of content.
Smart contracts are used to show users proof-of-interest in requested content, and a refunded deposit
incentivizes requesters/backers to validate submitted content. IPFS's content-based addressing ensures
that there is no tampering of the distributed content after its upload.

##Development Deployment

**Dependencies**:
* npm
* ipfs-mini
* [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/)
* [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/)

**Creating Ethereum Environment**
This project is developed using the Truffle framework.
To build the smart contracts, run `truffle compile`. Then to instantiate a fake blockchain+network, execute `truffle develop`.
This will launch a prompt where the command `migrate` can be entered to deploy the compiled EtherBay contract to the test blockchain.

**Setup IPFS**
Since we are the webserver, we should be the ones running the IPFS gateway that we query.
Follow instructions [here](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/) to install an ipfs gateway peer.
The result should be a daemon ipfs gateway with an API port open on port 5001.

**Run the Webserver**
To run the webserver on port 8080, in a separate console run `npm run dev`.
